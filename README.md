# Leebo Coop

We're a group of friends who want to organise and support more shared living projects. This is a cooperative, non profit mission.

We're using [a group on elinor](https://app.elinor.network/groups/a5901da5-c23e-11ec-9614-960000e2102b) to manage funds and vote on proposals.

Projects should fit these criteria:

- Minimum of 2 weeks
- Capacity for at least 6 people (at the same time)
- Non profit projects
  - If you are paid some money for the time you spend organising a project, that's okay. Just make it clear to everyone involved. If you're doing this with the specific intention to earn money, don't pitch your project to the coop.
- Spaces with a focus on shared living
  - Not just party spaces
  - The primary mission should be to live (and very likely work) together for a period of time.
- Money should be paid back to the coop
  - The coop doesn't exist to pay for events. It **loans** money to its members so the member can organise a project. Then the people who participate in that project pay their share, and the money goes back to the coop.
- You're not obliged to invite all the members of the coop to your project
- Only members of the coop can propose projects and you should be involved in some way.
  - Don't pitch ideas of your friends, people you met on a bus, etc.
