# Leebo Coop

We're a group of friends who want to organise and support more shared living projects. This is a cooperative, non profit mission.

We're using [a group on elinor](https://app.elinor.network/groups/a5901da5-c23e-11ec-9614-960000e2102b) to manage funds and vote on proposals.

Projects should fit these criteria:

- Minimum of 2 weeks
- Capacity for at least 6 people (at the same time)
- Non profit projects
  - If you are paid some money for the time you spend organising a project, that's okay. Just make it clear to everyone involved. If you're doing this with the specific intention to earn money, don't pitch your project to the coop.
- Spaces with a focus on shared living
  - Not just party spaces
  - The primary mission should be to live (and very likely work) together for a period of time.
- Money should be paid back to the coop
  - The coop doesn't exist to pay for events. It **loans** money to its members so the member can organise a project. Then the people who participate in that project pay their share, and the money goes back to the coop.
- You're not obliged to invite all the members of the coop to your project
- Only members of the coop can propose projects and you should be involved in some way.
  - Don't pitch ideas of your friends, people you met on a bus, etc.

## Submitting a Proposal

Create a document somewhere online (please don't use Google Docs), we like https://pad.systemli.org/ as a good, privacy friendly option.

In that document, clearly share the following information:

- Dates of the project
- Location of the venue
  - Maybe include a link to the rental web site (airbnb, etc)
- Cost of the whole project
- How much money you want the coop to provide
- Will you (or another organiser) be paid, and if so, how much
- Your plan to cover the costs, including topics like:
  - Will people join for the whole time, or will some people join for part
  - How much will each person pay, is that per week, for the whole time, etc
  - Who will you invite, how will you invite them, and so on
  - When will people pay
